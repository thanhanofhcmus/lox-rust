# lox-rust

A lox port to `rust` with author flavor on it.

## Todos:
- Make last expression in a block return the value of the block (like rust)
- Make `while`, `if` statement does not need a semicollon
- Implement `map` data structure and
- Add scope, (may be with `module` keyworld)
- Maybe implement node-id
- Do other chapters

## Bugs:
